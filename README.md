# MoErgo Glove80 Custom Configuration for ZMK

This is my custom keyboard configuration for my Glove80. It is basically a fork of the [Sunaku Glorious Engrammer](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps) keymap, with a couple of changes specific to me.

Overall changes:
- Removal of symbol and emoji and world layers
- Some changes of the keymap on the thumb cluster
- Use QWERTY by default, remove other keymaps

I came from the Ergodox and am heavily influenced by the default keymap layout of the Ergodox.
